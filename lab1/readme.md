 Description of Key Features
 Example Programs
- **Functions & Pointers:** Demonstrates the use of function overloading with pointers and references.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Implementation of a `Complex` class that includes constructor overloading and operator overloading.
- **Templates:** Use of function and class templates for generic programming.
- **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files using `ifstream` and `ofstream`.

 Exercises
- **Exercise 1.1:** Extends the `Complex` class to include multiplication of complex numbers.
- **Exercise 1.2:** Implements a template class to find the minimum of two values.
- **Exercise 1.3:** Enhances the sequence template class to compute maximum and minimum values.
- **Exercise 1.4:** Reads a text file and counts characters, words, and sentences.
- **Exercise 1.5:** Implements a `House` class to store and display real estate listings.
- **Exercise 1.6:** Reads student data from a file, calculates averages, and identifies top and bottom performers.

How to Compile and Run
Each program can be compiled using a C++ compiler such as g++. Example:
```sh
 g++ example1_2.cpp -o example1_2
 ./example1_2
```
For exercises involving file handling, ensure input files exist in the correct location.

 Requirements
- C++ Compiler (g++, clang, or MSVC)
- Standard C++ Libraries
- Text Editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks, CLion)

 Conclusion
This journal provides an in-depth look at C++ programming, covering essential concepts through practical examples and exercises. It is intended for students and developers looking to strengthen their understanding of C++.
